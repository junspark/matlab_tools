We have compiled the EPICS base on Windows following the instructions: http://www.aps.anl.gov/epics/tech-talk/2010/msg00595.php
We have used "Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition" instead of the "Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express Edition"; it worked well.

=============================================================================================================
Changes for WIN32 compilation:
- mca.cpp
- MCAError.h
- timereval.cpp
- /alt_compile/mcacompile_win32_mscc.m 
(instead of "mcacompile.win32.mscc.m", since Matlab is not recognizinig files with multiple dots in the name)
=============================================================================================================

Matlab release used is "Matlab R2007a (7.4.0)". Operating system is Windows XP with SP3.
Everything was successfully compiled with "Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition" installed in "C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8", with Microsoft SDK 6.1 installed in "c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.1\".

Some 'tweaking' was required for the following:
- Include the proper above mentioned SDK to Matlab 'mex' environment. Also needs to be set as a global environment variable of Windows XP.
Add environment variable to Windows XP: variable name is "MSSdk", variable value is "c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v6.1\"
- Compiler options: c:\MATLAB2007a\bin\win32\mexopts\msvc80freeopts.bat
Adding new values to PATH and INCLUDE variables in "General parameters"; proper SDK path and libs. 
This consequently changes the: "C:\Documents and Settings\user\Application Data\MathWorks\MATLAB\R2007a\mexopts.bat"
