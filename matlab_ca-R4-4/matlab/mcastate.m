% STATES = MCASTATE(H1,H2,...,HN) returns the states of 
%   the specified channels previously opened with MCAOPEN.
%   STATES = an array of the states of the channels listed in the HANDLES
%   array
%
% [HANDLES, STATES] = MCASTATE is an array of states of all

% Possible values
% 1 - Connected: MCAGET, MCAPUT and MCAMON are valid
% 0 - Disconnected: MCAGET, MCAPUT and MCAMON will return invalid
%     data or fail. This may be due to a server/network problem
